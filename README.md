# Kanjo-Game
## Set-up on the web editor
1) Download the files from the github in a .zip folder
2) Go to https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/latest/
3) Click "Choose file" next to the line of text "Preload project ZIP:"
4) Choose the .zip folder
5) Click the "start Godot editor" button

At this point you'll be taken to the editor's project page and will see a prompt "Install Project: Preload"  

6) Click on the "Create Folder" button, this will create a default folder for the project
7) Click on the "Install & Edit" button, this will launch you into the game

Now you should actually be in the code editor, from here you can poke around everything  
Since the UI is a little small, I suggest you press the F5 key to start up the game  

From now on you can just click "start Godot editor" and choose the project!
